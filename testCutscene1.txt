Healer
Do not fret, Your Majesty, the gods are with us and shall aid us in our plight.
King: Ah I see, we have a person of faith. Your light magic shall aid us greatly.
Wizard
Yes, yes, light magic is wonderful and all that. But wait until you see the magic that I can perform.
King: It is wonderful to see that a talented and powerful mage has heeded my call. Your magic will be a valuable asset in repelling the invader threat.
Queen: Dear, should there not be a fourth hero who will be aiding us in our time of need?

Hey, I'm just here for the monetary reward.

King: That I shall. My friends, I have called you here because we have been overrun with foreign invaders.
Fighter
I am very well aware of that Your Majesty. I presume our job will be to rout the enemy from our kingdom.

We will not fail, I promise you.
Healer
In the name of the gods, it shall be done.

We will ensure that they will no longer be a threat.
