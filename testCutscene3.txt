It was an arduous task. I almost fell off a crevice and lost my life. However, we successfully defeated the invaders.
Wizard
I have to say. That mine possessed some intriguing specimens that I would have loved to research more.
Rogue
You can say that again. So much shiny things to stuff my pockets.
Healer
By the gods, is the only thing you care about really money?
Rogue
You got that right. Didn't even need your gods to tell you that. What an accomplishment.
Healer
If I were not a holy person, I would strike you down right now.
Rogue
Bring it on. I can take you on.
Queen: Now, now. This is not the time to be fighting amongst yourselves.
Healer
I apologize your Majesty.
Rogue
...
Rogue
Fine, I'm sorry as well. Truce.
Healer
Truce.
King: Splendid. We still have important matters to discuss.
Queen: Our coastline is still being attacked by the invaders. Not to mention there is that ominous fortress that belongs to the invaders.
King: Yes, and while you did drive the invaders out of the caves, there is the possibility that they could come back.
Queen: We would like to ask what you all what you would like to do? What is your decision?
