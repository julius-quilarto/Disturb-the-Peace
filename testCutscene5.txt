Your Majesty, splendid tidings are upon us. We have successfully repelled the invading force.
King: Oh joyous day, this calls for celebration across the land.
Fighter
I agree. On this momentous day, we have finally repelled those accursed HUMANS from our lands.
Wizard
Yes, those HUMANS have been quite disruptive and dangerous for our kind.
Healer
I thank the gods that they sided with us MONSTERS and ensured our victory.
Rogue
Meh, I guess I'm happy that us MONSTERS get to stick around for a little bit longer.
Queen: Come everybody! Let us commence the festivities and celebrate our victory. For the glory of MONSTERKIND!
All The Monsters: Cheers!!!
<And thus, peace was restored to the land of the monsters. The monsters lived happily ever after without fear of the invading humans ever again.>
