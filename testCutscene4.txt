King: Is he in good health?
Wizard
Do not fret. He just got sea sick. That is all.
Wizard
There. There. I got you.
Rogue
Who would have thought that the mightiest fighter in the land had a weakness for the sea.
Rogue
HA HA HA HA HA!
Healer
Forgive me gods, but I cannot help but share the sentiment. That is quite funny. Heh heh.
Wizard
Any way, we found the invaders on an island and defeated them. What news do you have for us?
King: Well, there is still the foreboding fortress that belongs to the invaders.
Queen: In addition, an abandoned mine has been taken over by the invaders.
King: Although you may have defeated the invaders at sea, there is a chance that they could return.
King: So what do you say is the best choice of action?
Choice3 Fighter
Let us...go...to...the mine.
Oh gods...we...choose...the coastline.
...The fortress.
King: Very well. I wish you nothing but success. Also, before you leave, we have some medicine for your sickness.
Fighter
Thank you. Will do.
